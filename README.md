### Demand Forecasting for a Retail Store

This repository contains code for forecasting sales in a retail store using historical sales data. The dataset used in this project includes information about sales from multiple stores and items over a period of time. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts future sales based on various factors such as store, item, and time.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of two main files:

1. `train.csv`: Contains historical sales data used for training the model.
2. `test.csv`: Contains data for testing the trained model's performance.

Both files contain the following columns:

- `date`: The date of the sale.
- `store`: The store number.
- `item`: The item number.
- `sales`: The number of units sold on a particular date.

### Code Overview

The code provided in this repository is written in Python and utilizes several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning model building. Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, LightGBM, SHAP, and scikit-learn. It then loads the training and testing data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. The data is parsed to ensure the date column is in the correct format.

2. **Data Exploration**: Various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset. This includes checking the shape of the data, examining the number of unique stores and items, analyzing the time range of the data, computing summary statistics for stores and items, and visualizing histograms of store sales and item sales.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering is an essential step in preparing the data for modeling. While not explicitly shown in the provided code, this step involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive performance of the model.

4. **Model Building**: The code uses LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, for building the sales forecasting model. Time series cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit) is utilized for evaluating the model's performance. GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV is employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's parameters.

5. **Model Interpretation**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are calculated to interpret the model's predictions and understand the importance of features in predicting sales.

6. **Visualization**: Various visualizations are created throughout the code to illustrate patterns and relationships in the data. This includes histograms of store sales, time series plots of item sales for each store, and a correlation heatmap showing the relationship between store sales over time.
